<!-- Description -->
This is a web app to save commands of differents food products, show the commands and informations about them (client, food products included, date of the command, etc).

## Context
<!-- Why am i making this -->
This is one of our second year classroom project to learn PHP basics.

## Tools used
<!-- Packages, external librairies, IDE, utilitaries used -->
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [WAMP Server](https://www.wampserver.com/)


## How does it work
<!-- What we have to do to make it work/run -->
* just clone the source code
* the "sql database" folder contains the sql database (obviously lol ðŸ˜…), you just have to import it in a "restoapp" database created before (i used WAMP to manage it)

## Output:
