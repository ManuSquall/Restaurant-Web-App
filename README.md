# Restaurant-Web-App / Squall

This is a web app to save commands of differents food products, show the commands and informations about them (client, food products included, date of the command, etc).

## How does it work:
* just clone the source code
* the "sql database" folder contains the sql database (obviously lol ðŸ˜…), you just have to import it in a "restoapp" database created before (i used WAMP to manage it)
